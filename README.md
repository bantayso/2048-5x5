2048-5x5
========

The 2048 5x5 app is a fun, addictive and a very simple puzzle game. Join the numbers and get to the 2048 tile! Smallest size app for 2048!

This is the android port of the 2048 game made by Gabriele Cirulli https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048 It's nothing fancy, just a webview that loads the localy stored html files of the original game. I just wanted to make it instantly playable without internet (the app doesn't require any permissions) and with a quick access icon for my smartphone.

Feel free to contribute with pull requests to the original project by Gabriele or to this one if you have any android specific improvements in mind.
